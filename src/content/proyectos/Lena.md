### **Project Overview**
Estudio Lena’s website serves as both a legal resource and contact hub for accident and injury cases, managed by a team of legal experts. This site doubles as a user conversion landing page, strategically designed to funnel traffic from social media into online “pre-case” initiation, streamlining both client onboarding and case management for the law firm.

#### **Objectives**
- **Digital Presence**: Reinforce Estudio Lena’s reputation in personal injury and accident law.
- **User Conversion Funnel**: Engage social media-driven traffic and simplify the client intake process through an automated “pre-case” form.
- **Streamlined Management System**: Enhance internal workflows with a tailored content management structure for team collaboration.
- **Accessibility & SEO**: Optimize for accessibility, ensuring wide reach and easy usability.

#### **Project Workflow**
1. **Discovery & Planning**: Established a brand message and designed a legal-focused UX/UI to inspire trust and professionalism.
2. **UX/UI Design**: Structured the site with clear navigation across pages like “About,” “Practice Areas,” and “Contact,” emphasizing user-friendly layout and smooth navigation.
3. **Content Strategy**: Organized content around primary legal services, spotlighting areas like “Accidents” and “Free Consultations” to align with user search intent.
4. **Automated Pre-Case Form**: Added a form that lets users initiate cases online, reducing intake times and enhancing client tracking for the legal team.
5. **Testing & Optimization**: Performed usability and performance testing to verify site speed, SEO, and user experience.

#### **Technologies Used**
- **WordPress**: Provides easy content management and backend data tracking for the team.
- **DIVI Builder**: Allows modular, flexible design suitable for evolving content needs.
- **Custom HTML/CSS/JS**: Tailored dynamic features and streamlined form interactions for a smoother user experience.

#### **Results and Impact**
- **Improved Conversion Rate**: Social media-optimized landing page design increased client inquiries and conversions.
- **Enhanced Workflow**: Automated “pre-case” initiation system improved intake efficiency and team collaboration.
- **Brand Authority**: A professional and functional website establishes Estudio Lena as a leader in personal injury law, providing both credibility and convenience.
